      %h2 Volunteer Program
      %p
        We love our volunteers, and we know that we would be lost without them. There are lots of volunteer opportunities at La Cocina, and, more than anything, we
        believe in building a community between our staff, program participants and volunteers. Read on for information on the volunteer program, and please feel free to
        be in touch if you have any questions at all. To join our volunteer program, please begin with

      %p
        La Cocina’s volunteer program can essentially be divided into three parts; technical assistance providers, mentors and general volunteers . Some volunteers will fill
        all roles, but the role you fill will largely depend on how you would like to interact with the program and personal time constraints. Additionally, qualified volunteers
        may be asked to join our advisory committee, responsible for the interview process for applicant businesses.

      %h2 Technical Assistance Provider
      %p
        Technical assistance providers will offer industry- specific assistance in areas of expertise. Examples may include tax preparation, graphic design, recipe costing,
        branding and so more. These volunteers provide services at their convenience, and La Cocina will match program participants with these providers when the
        services are offered.
      %p
        We have found that one-on-one interaction often yields the greatest rewards, though we also welcome any workshops or activities that might be better executed in
        a group.

      %h2 Mentors
      %p
        Mentors are paired with a specific program participant in order to target development in a localized area of need. Mentors will address macro-issues like marketing,
        business planning and general emotional support for new entrepreneurs. These volunteers will schedule their own meetings with program participants, and will
        report back to La Cocina staff regularly.

      %h2 General Volunteers
      %p
        General volunteers work with La Cocina staff on events, farmer’s market, administration, fundraising and more. We love our volunteers, so come spend some time
        with us!

      %h2 Advisory Committee
      %p
        The La Cocina Advisory Committee consists of a hand-selected group of industry insiders who have been chosen to lend their expertise in the incubation of La
        Cocina program participants. You have been chosen because of your dedication to the La Cocina project and because of your valuable industry knowledge. The
        committee set-up will allow La Cocina staff to integrate your opinions, suggestions and advice into the program in a way that maximizes your impact and minimizes
        the time commitment that individual businesses might put on you.
